## Skillsy Beta 

Welcome to **Skillsy**, the digital compass for confused beginners navigating the chaotic universe of tech careers.

This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the platform—simple, honest, and built with clarity in mind. It's the first step toward a bigger vision: a personalized tool to help you explore tech paths, understand the roles available, and know exactly what to learn next—*without the overwhelm*.

### Why Skillsy Exists

As a first-year student juggling math, code, and identity crises, I realized something:  
Everyone in tech started confused. Most stay confused.  
And very few platforms explain **what tech actually is** without assuming you already know what "backend" or "API" means.

**Skillsy** is here to help early learners:
- Understand different tech career paths
- Explore simplified, beginner-friendly roadmaps
- Gain confidence before choosing a direction
- Feel less alone in their journey

No flashy login, no pressure to code right away. Just choose a path and get guidance. It’s your map, your pace.

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript 
- Deployed via GitHub Pages or Netlify (with love)

### Next Steps

- Add more career paths (Frontend, Data Science, Cybersecurity, etc...)
- Make roadmaps interactive
- Add quiz to recommend a path

### 🧡 Credits

Built by someone who used to fear starting.  
Now building slowly. Imperfectly. But building anyway.
